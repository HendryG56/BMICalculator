            Workout for people Overweight!

        <h5>
            Walking
        </h5>
        <label for="">
            This seems like an obvious choice, but there is a reason that walking tops the list of the best exercise for almost everyone. Walking requires very little equipment and it can be done almost everywhere. Walking is low impact, improves strength and mobility in the lower body, and can be easy, moderate, or vigorous depending on your specific plan.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keep in mind, however, that walking isn't for everyone. If you experience knee, back, or hip pain, talk to your healthcare provider. You may be able to work with a physical therapist or exercise professional to address the issue or come up with a better routine for fitness.

        <h5>
            Aqua Jogging
        </h5>
        <label for="">
            Water activities are particularly well suited for people who have painful joints or difficulty moving, but lap swimming is too intense for many people and water aerobics classes are not always available. A good alternative is aqua jogging.
            <br>
            <br>
            Aqua jogging is simply running in the water with the help of a buoyancy belt. You get all of the benefits of running or walking without the impact. You may be able to find a buoyancy belt at the pool where you swim or you can buy one online, then head to the deep end of the pool and begin jogging.
